/*
    ** Main Program **
    This program will be based on the color rule first, I will prioritize region over columns or rows (This doesn't really effect the complexity).

    Created by: Jenka
    NIM: 13524110

    PS: I cannot really use Vim, I do hope I can type without using Mouse or Touchpad. Have fun Kak :D

    I thanked for that one lonely karaoke timeline, a big W to my ex.

/*
    Flow state for the program:
    1. Inputs, minimum of 4, you can do 1, but not 2 and 3. Make the board.
    2. Find the first ever color to be found. Place the queen.
    3. Do another region, and iterate rule number 2 until all queens are placed.
    4. Validate, is the position right? Yes --> stop program; No --> Continue

    Some constraints:
    1. No backtracking, no early pruning.
    2. No heuristics :D 
    3. Be naive as possibly as you can.
